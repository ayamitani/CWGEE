Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Aya", "Mitani", email = "ayamitani@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package includes functions to fit a model using cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations (CWGEE) for clustered longitudinal data with informative cluster size (ICS). For ordinal outcomes, use the function ordCWGEE. Function for binary outcomes is coming soon. For cross-sectional data with multiple correlated binary outcomes, use the function mvoCWGEE. A simulated example data sets (perio, perio_base) are available. 
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), geepack, gee, MASS, fastDummies, matrixcalc
